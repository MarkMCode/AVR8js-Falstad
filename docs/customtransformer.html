You can use the custom transformer element to create more complex transformers.  Edit the transformer's description
to specify what kind of transformer you want.
<p>
An example description is: <tt>1:1</tt>.  That is a simple transformer with an equal number of turns in the primary
and secondary.  The inductance of each winding is equal to the "Base Inductance".
<p>
<tt>1:10</tt> gives you a step-up transformer.  The secondary has 10 times as many turns as the primary (so
it has 100 times the base inductance).
<p>
<tt>1,2:3</tt> gives you a transformer with two primary windings.  The second primary winding has twice as many
turns as the first.  The secondary winding has 3 times as many.  The only difference between primary and secondary
windings is how they're displayed on the screen.
<p>
<tt>1:.5+.5</tt> gives you a tapped transformer.
<p>
<tt>1:1+2</tt> gives you a tapped transformer where the first part of the secondary has as many turns as the primary,
and the second part has twice as many.
<p>
<tt>1,-1:1</tt> gives you a transformer with two primary windings, where the bottom winding has its polarity swapped.
<p>
So, the description is a list of windings separated by commas, with <tt>:</tt> to separate primary and secondary,
and <tt>+</tt> to separate parts of a tapped coil.
