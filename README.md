# AVR8js-Falstad
Project combining Wokwi's AVR8js Arduino simulator (https://github.com/wokwi/avr8js) and Paul Falstad's CircuitJS1 circuit simulator (https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1).

## Running
To run this project, simply open /war/index.html in a compatible browser (known to work with Chrome)

## Using
1. Write an Arduino script in the Arduino IDE
2. Select Sketch => Export compiled binary
3. Open the compiled hex file in a text editor and copy the contents to clipboard
4. Paste this into the text area on the right side of AVR8js-Falstad
5. Select Draw => Add Arduino Pin and drag out an Arduino pin element (currently, they are drawn as voltage sources and the negative side must be connected to a ground element)
6. Create your circuit and double click on each Arduino Pin element to change which pin it represents

## Building
To build the CircuitJS1 part of the application, follow the instructions at https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1#building-the-web-application ***Note:You must be using GWT version 2.8.1 and JDK 1.8.0 to build this. The compiler argument -generateJsInteropExports must be passed***

To build the avr8js part of the application, read the README in /avr8js and use "npm run-script build:demo". This utilises my edited package.json file.

To integrate these two, move the contents of /avr8js/demo/dist to /war/AVR8js and edit the JS file argument on line 99 of /src/com/lushprojects/circuitjs1/client/circuitjs1.java (motorScript.setPropertyString("src", "AVR8js/src.30e1f952.js")) to reflect the new file being used.
